It's an assurance to each of us beginning this journey that it is possible to get there:

This is Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah.

I'm excited to welcome you to this WhatsApp group #AskPyFesh!

Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
10/23/19, 10:17 PM - +234 706 130 1525: Good evening
10/23/19, 10:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm sure we have all gone through the group description and have an idea what this all about.

I will do quick recap.
10/23/19, 10:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah == Fesh.
So please feel free to use whichever comes faster and more convenient to you.
10/23/19, 10:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This group is geared towards all who are desirous of learning the *python programming language* whatever level they are from beginner to advanced.
10/23/19, 10:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm aware we have some fairly proficient developers here and I'm glad we are here together. Your contributions will be most welcome as we go on.

However, we will start this first event from the *very basics* of learning the language.
10/23/19, 10:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hopefully you have followed this link and your computer is setup to go. If not, you have it there to use.
10/23/19, 10:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If this is the first programming language you are learning then you are in luck.

Python is a high level programming language. This means it is closer to human language than machine language. So pretty much every line of python at a closer look, will be readable just like everyday sentences. Well, mostly.
10/23/19, 10:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the most puzzling questions for me starting off was: _what can I do with the knowledge of this language_

If you have not asked yourself this question, I'm not sure what you can take away from this group but just maybe you will get a bit more clarity after this short session.
10/23/19, 10:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python is a very versatile language and can be used to develop Python can be used to develop different things like web applications, graphic user interface based applications, software development application, scientific and numeric applications, network programming, Games and 3D applications and other business applications.
10/23/19, 10:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some of the popular services heavily built around python include:
Google
YouTube
Quora
Dropbox
Yahoo
Reddit
Spotify...
10/23/19, 10:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: And... Instagram!
10/23/19, 10:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the factors driving the adoption of this language today is its suitability for data and data related operations.
10/23/19, 10:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of all the various things python can lend itself to, we are mostly going to gravitate towards data analytics and web development. This are arguably two of the most prominent uses of this languages.
10/23/19, 10:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: More so, Python is a magnificent scripting language very good at achieving automation of processes.
10/23/19, 10:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To cap up this introduction at the 15minute mark I am going to ask anyone on their computer to pull up the command prompt so we write our very first python program. It consists of a form of ritual in every language: hello world.
10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you followed the setup text and tested it ok as advised, pull up a command prompt and type 'python' then hit the return key.

You will have the python prompt looking like this

>>>
10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Type in

_print("Hello World")_

Hit the return key.
You just wrote your first script in python.
10/23/19, 10:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will now outline some resources we can use for learning.

On a desktop, I will recommend using the *jupyter notebook*

To get it, download and install Anaconda from this link
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

At installation, remember to check the box asking to add it to _PATH_ or _environmental variable_
10/23/19, 10:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have a low memory PC, don't bother installing Anaconda. It might slow things down for you.

You can install jupyter notebook and it's dependencies by opening your command prompt and typing

_pip install jupyter notebook_

I'm presuming you already have python installed and have an internet connection.
10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To launch the notebook, create a new folder somewhere on your desktop, and open it up.

Hold down the shift key and right click on a blank area (making sure nothing is selected if the folder has any contents), select _open command prompt (or powershell) here_ depending on the version of windows you are using.


This opens a command prompt in that very directory/folder/location.

Type:
_jupyter notebook_

Hit enter. The notebook fires up and opens on a browser.

If you are on a Mac or Linux please indicate later if you will need some guidance.
10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you can reach a browser but cannot afford to install packages, the site pythonanywhere.com has resources for you.
10/23/19, 10:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are on a mobile, get the app _SoloLearn_.

The _Code playground_ can be used to write and save code.
10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, one of the best _free_ resource I have come across for learning this language is w3schools.com/python

I will refer to it a lot and will practically follow its outline. Make it your encyclopedia.
10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will stop here for some questions from the house.
10/23/19, 10:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good evening and welcome once again.
10/23/19, 10:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll call it a day at 11:15pm Lagos time.
10/23/19, 10:51 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Good evening. You said Python is used for web development.

1. Does it mean that HTML, CSS and JavaScript are outdated?
2. I'm a newbie in coding and which would you recommend I learn for web development between python and the ones I listed above?
10/23/19, 10:56 PM - Budo: Python is the way to go
10/23/19, 10:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Web development can be complicated sometimes and many people misunderstand what is required. That said, there are two aspects of web development: the front end and the backend.

The front end is where the items on _1_ in your list come in. JavaScript has frameworks for the back two. Node.js being the most popular.

However, the backend is where the logic is the site resides. This is where python frameworks are a great asset. These include Django and Flask amongst others.

For the web with python, after learning the basics, you will need to zero in on a web framework so you can develop the backend with it. When done, with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you get string a front end to it and have a full site from static to full fledged web apps like e-commerce and game sites.
10/23/19, 10:58 PM - +234 903 182 7815: You can use Python for back end web development. Python web dev frameworks include: Django, Flask and Falcon.
10/23/19, 10:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: HTML and CSS are not programming languages, they are markup languages.
10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Ohh thank you very much üôÇ
10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: HTML and CSS are essential for building a website.
10/23/19, 11:00 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Python comes in as a replacement to PHP not those ones you mentioned.
10/23/19, 11:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many thanks Sam. üëçüëç

Let's keep it simple for the beginners and not use too many terms that will confuse them for a take off.

With time they will get the hang of it.
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 706 444 3217: so, Python and PHP can't be used together?
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Noted sir.

Thanks for organizing the platform sir.
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úå
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: No you can't. They both do same thing.

10/23/19, 11:03 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks bro
10/23/19, 11:05 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: @Pascal, which one is betterjupyter or anaconda
10/23/19, 11:06 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Is it advisable to use cmd for coding?
10/23/19, 11:07 PM - +234 706 214 9878: Thanks Fesh for this wonderful session!
10/23/19, 11:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Jupyter notebook is an environment for writing code. Anaconda is an assemblage of tools and libraries put together for ease of use by developers and one of the many environments in it is the jupyter notebook. Spyder is another environment and it is included in the Anaconda package.
10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you went through the reference text you will see that though you can write code in the command prompt after teaching the python prompt, you have no way of saving it.

For that it is not advisable to to do as it is mostly a waste of time.

Use it when you are running your scripts. Something we will get to explain going forward.
10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You are welcome Henry. ‚úåÔ∏è
10/23/19, 11:11 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks  Fesh

10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Any assignment?
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I have that passion
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I want to be like u
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first for you and for all new people is to get your own computer, install python and get the jupyter notebook.

This way you will be ready to kick off. Scroll up a bit and find the installation guide.

Then go ahead to w3schools.com/python and start familiarizing yourself with the basics. Ask questions here when you hit a snag.

Real take homes will come much later as we progress.
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm here to help you get there and far beyond. Just keep moving.
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks Fesh
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: When is the meet up ...and the duration.
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - +234 706 753 8706: Hi @2349081987335. Thank you for this amazing group.
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's wrap ladies and gentlemen.

I will answer more questions as they come in on the session we had and generally on beginner stuff. It's important you setup your computer if you want to move along.

For the rest of us who are not totally new, bear with us as we bring the great new guys up to speed.

Meanhwile, drop any questions you have on any level of the language and myself and some experienced folk in here will give you a hand.

Remember _there are several roads to Aba_.

A single issue can be solved in many ways. The best solution is the one that solves the problem. After that you try the fastest and the least resource sapping.

Best regards.
10/23/19, 11:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Meets are in the incubator. We will stay here in the virtual world for a while and contemplate meet ups later. They sure are most likely to come.
10/23/19, 11:21 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I was actually asking for the time for the session
10/23/19, 11:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
They will be fortnightly if time permits. Either way, they will be announced days ahead.

Thanks for the clarification. ‚úå

10/24/19, 8:18 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *#PythonTip_byFesh*

Python is object oriented and almost everything in the language is an object. This is a very important aspect that determines a lot of things.

Every object has its ```properties``` and ```methods``` .

To work with each, one need know what properties they posses and what ```method``` they respond to.

To find the type of an object do:
_type(object)_

Eg:
aList = [1, 2, "Fred"]
aTuple = (1, 2, "Fred") 

aList is a python list and possess the properties as well as responds to the methods of a list.

 ```Properties``` : mutable, iterable.
 ```Methods``` : append(), pop(), index(), sort() etc

_aTuple_ is a Tuple.
Essentially a python list but different in that it's ```immutable``` : cannot be changed once created. Responds to two methods _index()_  and _count()_. Being immutable they cannot be sorted, appended to, members popped etc.

The object type determines what properties it possess and what methods it responds to.
10/24/19, 8:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Teaser*: Find the basic data types in python, their properties and the methods they respond to.

Google is your friend.

Good morning from Lagos. ‚úå

10/25/19, 9:07 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For the new one, if you will like to be enumerated, please send a message with the tag #AskPyFeshIntro with your name and location.

We shall have an ipython notebook of an analysis of this group with a plot of which locations we joined from. The notebook will be made available on Github and I will share the link here.
10/25/19, 9:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For the absolute Python beginners and the rest of us learners, if you want to really learn the language, you *need* to have a laptop or least a PC you can reach on demand.

Then you will need *internet connection from time to time* to download modules.
10/25/19, 9:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is not an event, but general info. You can catch up at your own time.
10/25/19, 9:10 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *New _joins_*

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-python-data-analysis-amah-paschal-chukwuemeka

Ensure the test at the end comes out fine, opening the python prompt.
10/25/19, 9:13 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The tool of choice is jupyter notebook.

I will now outline some resources we can use for learning.

On a desktop, I will recommend using the *jupyter notebook*

To get it, download and install Anaconda from this link
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

At installation, remember to check the box asking to add it to _PATH_ or _environmental variable_

It might throw a warning in red, *ignore* it and proceed. This is so you can reach the notebook at a command prompt.
10/25/19, 9:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, realizing there are a number absolute beginners in the mix, I have decided to push out twice a week begging from today, lessons from w3schools.com/python.

For today, ensure you have setup your PC then cover the topic on that page from _Python Intro_ to _Python Variables_.

It's _readable_ so you can read only. However, for a hands-on experience, pull up your pythin prompt from the command prompt and follow.
10/25/19, 9:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Best of the starting weekend.

10/26/19, 10:40 AM - +234 812 053 1560: C is the correct answer
10/26/19, 10:42 AM - +234 812 053 1560: C is the correct answer dictionary class using the sorted function to iterate within an argument.
10/26/19, 10:44 AM - +234 701 291 2307: I'll go with B, I think the sorted() method will sort only the values.
10/26/19, 11:00 AM - +234 803 711 3263: C is the correct ans
10/26/19, 11:02 AM - +234 810 831 6393: C is the answer
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - +234 812 053 1560: And it returns a new list...
10/26/19, 11:06 AM - +234 803 604 4312: The answer is ‚ÄúC‚Äù the sorted functions will arrange alphabetically or in order.... in this situation, the values are the most important arguments to sort hence you get this as output  [‚ÄòA‚Äô, ‚ÄòB‚Äô, ‚ÄòC‚Äô]
10/26/19, 11:09 AM - Adafin: C came on as the answer.. I don't know the reason why but run the code and it prints ['A', 'B', 'C']
10/26/19, 11:17 AM - +234 706 214 9878: C is the correct answer.

Why? I'm not sure but I believe it performed a sorting function on the alphabets. Paying attention to only the string values
10/26/19, 11:26 AM - +234 813 855 8745: A and B should be because the sorted function i think doesn't run when you have a list with both strings and numbers
10/26/19, 11:26 AM - +234 813 855 8745: Shouldn't*
10/26/19, 11:27 AM - +234 810 831 6393: It does
10/26/19, 11:31 AM - +234 706 214 9878: It actually does..
10/26/19, 11:32 AM - +234 813 855 8745: You cannot sort a list that contains BOTH string values AND numeric values
10/26/19, 11:32 AM - +234 813 855 8745: You tried it?

Pydroid is beautiful! 

It has as good an IDE as SoloLearn's Code Playground but better interpreter. It's able to take user input one by one unlike the Code Playground. More so, it has recourse for install and loading modules. Integrates with Pastebin. For other languages, the owners have other app offering. 

SoloLearn has a full feature learning resource/course and challenge system for practise as well as a large repo of scripts from its user community which includes several other programming and markup languages. 

*Recommendation*
_Running code_ == pydroid
_Learning_ == SoloLearn.

10/26/19, 4:06 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Well looking at your image, I don‚Äôt know how much you use python.... but if you are a beginner in python, I think you should ignore these words with double underscore, and learn about that as you progress in python.... but note that they are inbuilt variables for the python
10/26/19, 4:13 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you, I didn't know of the sorted() method until today, so I'm trying to look all dict methods to see what they does
10/26/19, 4:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I don't use spyder a lot but from your screenshot, this is Spyder giving you hints about methods available to you based on what you typed in. Spyder is an advanced IDE so sometimes it is a handful for beginners.

A rough guess is you are dealing with python a dictionary as _values_ is one of the things that popped up at the top.

Stick to simpler IDEs like the jupyter notebook, Atom, Sublime Text (free version), VScode etc, till you get comfortable. 

If you started with Spyder then no issue. You can keep at it if you are going to d with it.
10/26/19, 4:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip on question asking when it relates to coding*

A screenshot can say more than a whole textbook.
On your PC, use the PrtScr (Print screen) button to copy your screen to the clipboard. Many keyboards have it as a Function key so you light need to hold down the _Fn_ key somewhere on the space bar row to have it work.

10/26/19, 7:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üòÇ
10/26/19, 9:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The answer here is *C*
10/26/19, 9:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: python *sorted()* function on a _dictionary_ will by default return a sorted list of the keys of the dictionary provided they are of similar type (strings vs numbers).
10/26/19, 9:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/26/19, 9:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úîÔ∏è
Reason: default sort by sorted() on a dictionary acts on the keys.
10/26/19, 9:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _sorted(a.values())_

will return a list of the dictionary values sorted provided they are of similar types.
10/26/19, 9:05 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Yea my bad, meant to write ‚Äúkeys‚Äù mix up key&values a lot for dict type
10/26/19, 9:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: sort() is a different method that words exclusively on python lists and returns values with inplace, ie, it alters the original list. _sorted()_ returns a fresh list without altering the original and works on any object that is iterable.

Can you give me an instance where sorted() will be used. (Why someone will want a dictionary keys to be sorted)

Thank you
10/27/19, 7:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Any case/scenario where some form of hierarchy is needed in normal or reverse order _sorted()_ will be very handy.

In a data set for analysis, a dictionary holding values user data might need to be sorted alphabetically in ascending or descending order for uniformity and some order.

A dictionary of English words (words for keys and values for meaning) will make more sense sorted alphabetically.

In a webapp where an API call returns a series of JSON query, it might be needful to know which response was received before the order to determine which transaction happened first, or which transactions failed or succeeded.

There are several scenario but these come to my mind now.

10/28/19, 11:34 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Best of the new week to all.

We will discuss a bit about what career paths a python developer can pursue. What kinds of jobs one can land armed with this programming language.
*Time*:

10/28/19, 9:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello python people.
10/28/19, 9:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good evening. 
Sorry this is coming 2 minutes late.
Apologies.
10/28/19, 9:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I am going to briefly speak about job opportunities for people who know this language well.
10/28/19, 9:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *0. Data Science*
This is arguably the hottest portfolio worldwide. It is not so big in Nigeria as say in Europe or the US and Canada, but it is steadily growing in leaps and bounds.
10/28/19, 9:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many people, including hiring organisations misunderstand _data science_ and presume that once it is mentioned, it must be about Machine Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence. No.
10/28/19, 9:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Data Science involves everything from data mining, data cleaning, data engineering, exploratory data analysis, to natural language processing (a favorite of mine), machine learning and artificial intelligence.
10/28/19, 9:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The areas listed above and more (data visualization, data pipeline, big data analytics) are full fledged jobs that companies are asking more and more for today.
10/28/19, 9:25 PM - +234 703 080 5323: üíØ
10/28/19, 9:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python is one of the best tool for these items. Other tools are available too: SQL, R, SASS, SPSS, Tableau, PowerBI, Qlik etc. What python brings to the table (and probably R too) is the fact that, you can, armed with it, go into the _wild_ and retrieve data. The rest need that data ready for them to an extent to work although they are increasing building capacity to get data from more sources. PowerBI for eg is getting more sources added.
10/28/19, 9:29 PM - +234 805 411 5331: OK
10/28/19, 9:29 PM - +234 805 411 5331: After downloading anaconda what next
10/28/19, 9:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To be able to play in this space, apart from the basics of the language, mastery of some libraries are a must. They include numpy, (the ubiquitous) pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib to mention only these here.
10/28/19, 9:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *1. Python Developer*

Severacl companies have python developed systems that are running v2 and need to upgrade to v3. This is especially as v2 support is ending soon. Python developer roles are increasing because of this need to update the code base to v3.
10/28/19, 9:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Every organisation today needs a way to track their processes. More so, many are going to the web to stay connected as against using legacy desktop apps. The web removes the need for costly software and updates. 

Python is well suited to process automation and has two rock solid web frameworks: Django (my preferred) and Flask. Companies are out to score people who have knowledge of these frameworks.
10/28/19, 9:36 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python developers also build data science solutions and make them available on the web.
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Companies today hire python developers (data science hands in particular) for several other jobs just know that they have people who can manipulate data in case they need them. So, even for an unrelated role, knowledge of python could give one an advantage as they will feel you are an asset.
10/28/19, 9:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, job titles you will see that require the language include:
_data analyst, business analyst, business intelligence analyst, data engineer, machine learning engineer, data scientist, python developer, django developer_ etc.

For a feeler of what the responsibilities are, search the Jobs section of LinkedIn and other job sites for these titles and see what they list in their description.

10/28/19, 9:42 PM - +234 816 398 2854: As a business analyst, can you also double as a business analyst, or do you need to have am understanding of business in a small light?
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Sorry I meant, as a data analyst, can you also double as a business analyst
10/28/19, 9:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have some PMs on how to use the jupyter notebook.

If you have installed conda properly as advised (checking the mark to add to PATH) and/or pip installed jupyter notebook, to use the notebook, open your command prompt and type:

_jupyter notebook_
It will start the engine and open the notebook in a browser. At the top right hand corner, click on 'new' and choose _python 3_ to start a notebook.
10/28/19, 9:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
10/28/19, 9:48 PM - +234 903 881 9790: Done
10/28/19, 9:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes you can.
Matter of fact, sometimes recruiters mixed both up.
What is always obtainable is that, to work in an area, apart from being able to manipulate data, you should have a fair amount of knowledge of the operations of that industry. For eg, to work in the banking industry, a knowledge of financial things will always make things easier for you if you take up any of these roles with them. Though you can work with data, you need to still understand what variables are important in determining a possible default in giving a person a loan. It's needed to add to your ability to find correlations between the data points you are provided with.
10/28/19, 9:50 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Sorry you forgot to mention the OOP side of python. Basically the same thing a java programming language does can also be done with python too
10/28/19, 9:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is a good tutorial for working with a jupyter notebook:
https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/
10/28/19, 9:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: More like we have not come to that area yet.
I am presuming it is part of the foundation a learner has to have to feel they are ready to take on roles in this thing of ours.

As it is a topic that is critical and often quite confusing for beginners, I thought to not bother about it yet till we get most people here where they can comfortably tackle it. If we start talking OOP at this stage we might have several _miscarriages_. Dunno if you feel same too.
10/28/19, 9:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, at a point we *must* have to face OOP.
10/28/19, 9:55 PM - +234 903 881 9790: üí™
10/28/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Especially if data science is not where we want to land but versatility to take up any python related role, meaning flexibility to feel a wide range of roles.
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I understand.... took my 5 years to fully get a full grasp of OOP learning with Java. So since u were mentioning all the things that could be done hence I thought you missed it. But it‚Äôs fine totally agree
10/28/19, 9:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
Cool.
Sorry, Java is brutal guy.
Don't scare us yet though. üòÉ

If we move well, OOP might just be a breeze and not take us too long to grasp.
I struggled with it at a point too. With my struggle, I believe I know the pain points and can fairly guide anyone ready to get past it.
10/28/19, 9:59 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Thanks for this... cheers

10/29/19, 1:30 AM - +234 813 533 2067: Hello Pascal, I was having this conversation with a friend of mine who is into data science since that's the area I am also looking at, and he told me point blank that using the Spyder IDE is far more preferable to using the jupyter notebook especially if you aren't a fan on working in your browser, what's your take on that Sir?
10/29/19, 7:05 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Whatever works for a learner is good provided it gets the work done.

That said, jupyter notebook is beginner friendly as one learns the basics. Spyder is great but half of the time a beginner will likely be struggling with the interface.

Another thing that influences  IDE preference is the type of project. For Django development, jupyter notebook is practically impossible to use so personally I user any of Sublime Text, Atom or VSCode.

For data science it's not impossible but rather _very strange_ the person is averse to jupyter notebook. ü§î

_PS: had to delete to correct typos_.

*Bonus for today.*

Have you thought of a script that searches Google and returns results organised into a table for easy reference? Above is link to one on SoloLearn.

Even if you are a beginner, you can go through it to see the flow of the code and see if you can make sense of some parts of it.

For more experienced people, it's open to modification and use. You will see how to interact with an API (Google's).

10/29/19, 9:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea. It won't run on SoloLearn as some modules need to be imported and their _Code Playround_ doesn't support imports

More so, you will need your own Google dev account keys to pass authentication. If you have one (a breeze to create; minutes) copy the code and run on your computer.
10/29/19, 9:22 AM - +234 903 895 4127: Alright. Let me try do it
10/29/19, 9:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: http://valvepress.com/how-to-create-a-google-custom-search-api-key/

For those interested in giving the code up there a shot, this is how to get the required keys.

If you have a Gmail account or are willing to create one, that's all you really need.

Play with the code, get it to do some things differently. Break it and fix it again if need be.

10/30/19, 7:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Like the name says, it gets the difference between the two sets.

But unlike _difference_ which returns the difference without touching the original set, it *updates* the affected set and alters it's contents.

So _difference_update_ is an *inplace* operation ie changes/alters the contents of original variable.

Yes ooo... We never get old at asking, learning and learning what we have learnt before again...
11/1/19, 8:58 AM - +234 812 053 1560: @2349081987335 Good morning. I somewhat agree with you but what is expected during an interview when you need to write code? Are you expected to google. Kindly throw some light in this perspective. It would be of help. Especially for some of us just embracing python and considering putting it in our CV. What happens if someone ask you at an interview to come and write some lines of code using for instance lambda; like in my case I know it exists and helpful to shorten code...lol I but I just always seem to google its use case scenarios. You feel me? Is this not tantamount to what we call script kiddie in Security?
11/1/19, 8:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Very good question.
11/1/19, 9:04 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have taken any serious coding test/challenge, you will know that though it is timed, it is a take home. Usually you are to submit it within 48-73 hours. Some will even give you a whole week. 

No one expects you to know the details of everything.

What a test wants to determine is your use of the language to solve issues.

So yes, in a test, you can Google to your satisfaction.
11/1/19, 9:04 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 72*
11/1/19, 9:06 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In Whiteboarding interviews, you are generally going to be writing pseudo code if you will ever be required to write code. It will usually be about setting out structures, patterns designs etc.
11/1/19, 9:23 AM - +234 812 053 1560: I dont know if this applies in the Nigerian context. I have met an overzealous interviewer who asked me rubbish on how much I understood python for a Security deployment I was amazed as if it was a developer role. You will not want to know the rest of the crazy story. First I was not allowed to google on my pc he rebuked and rebuffed my attempt to access a google page. 
He insisted I must craft script from inside my head is key. Okay olodo me I failed abi...Rubbish! Lol
11/1/19, 9:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Any interviewer who does that is the real olodo. Get up from there, greet them again and walk away.

You don't wanna work there.

Back in the day, I'd gone to one that gave me a sheet of paper to write code. I wonder what I was thinking. So, yes, there are a lot of confused HRs out there. Don't let them make you think you don't know what you are doing.

A real test should be on a computer. Even if you don't Google, you must need to try one expression or the other to see the outcome. Then if time permits, you might wanna refactor/optimize this and that more efficiency.
11/1/19, 9:39 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 9:42 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Once you know what is applicable, you can spot overzealous HRs and know your options. This is part of why I don't like outsourcing firms especially those who don't have dedicated IT headhunters. They will always look for the wrong things and leave you feeling if you really know anything where they are the ones who just don't get it.

Remember, for every challenge/test, just like in real production code, *No particular solution is the most correct by default*. The best is what works, then what uses the least resources etc.

11/2/19, 1:47 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I have 2 questions about Jupyter notebook usage.
1. When working with notebooks when we execute codes in cells multiple times the line numbers dont seem to follow s sequential order. Is there a way to force it to be ascending from ln[1] through ln[n]?

2. Starting up jupyter notebooks usually executes with IE automatically by default. How can we force it to execute with our favourite browser such as Chrome or firefox. I tried to tweak the _config.py file in .jupyter/ but cannot get chrome to auto start; 
After calling jupyter notebook in power shell, I still have to manually copy the path and port 8888 before I can start jupyter in my favourite browser. Any tips?
11/2/19, 1:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 2. Change your default web browser. On Windows go to Cortana or click Start or tap the Windows logo on the keyboard; type 'Default App' and open it. Find your browser and change the default. Jupyter will start opening with it.

1. One trick I use is to first make sure I save the notebook. It autosaves at intervals but for this I expressly click _save_.

Restart the kernel and start executing the cells from the beginning. The numbering will reset to 1 from the first you execute.
11/2/19, 2:07 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Thanks i will check out answer to 2 and revert. I read sometime ago about uncommenting a line in the .config.py file and putting the path for your favourite browser but couldn't get it to work properly. Thanks a lot @2349081987335
11/2/19, 2:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That will work too, (ignoring whatever is the default browser and opening with the designate browser) but it is invasive. You could upset some other things by mistake if you are not careful and break something.
11/2/19, 2:12 PM - +234 812 053 1560: üëç sure that's true. Will try though and revert to default if I break anything...
11/2/19, 2:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úå
11/2/19, 2:36 PM - +234 812 053 1560: @2349081987335 I found a quick fix for this which worked perfectly. 

I went to the jupyter_notebook_config.py file and added the code under line 267 to automate opening with chrome whenever I call jupyter notebook in powershell. Finding the correct path for your favorite browser should work as well but be careful not to mess with any other settings in the .config file if you are unsure how it works.

SEE CODE TO ADD BELOW:

import webbrowser
webbrowser.register('chrome', None, webbrowser.GenericBrowser(r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe'))
c.NotebookApp.browser = 'chrome'
11/2/19, 3:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. Great. üëç

Like I said, this is an _invasive_ (but permanent) way.

Glad you've sorted it out.

11/2/19, 5:17 PM - +234 803 604 4312: The best option was what paschal advised. Jupyter works with the default browser in your windows system by default. Directory paths are unique and different to individual systems, so the first option is still the easiest bet. Tweeking your config files could turn out really bad. Just ensure you memorized the tweek Incase anything goes wrong so u can easily revert.

Coming up.
11/2/19, 9:45 PM - +234 812 053 1560: ‚è∞
11/2/19, 9:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello good people.
Apologies!!
11/2/19, 9:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I was carried away.
11/2/19, 9:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If we have looked at w3schools.com/python we will see that there is a great syllable for the language there.
11/2/19, 9:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 9:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will start from the syntax. What I will note there is that python unlike a language like JavaScript, is sensitive to white line.
11/2/19, 9:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A white line is an empty space.
11/2/19, 9:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In some instance (loops, try/except), there's a compulsory indentation of some lines. The standard value is 4 lines but any consistent spacing will work even if it is a single space.
11/2/19, 9:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Python Variables*
11/2/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In python, the single equal sign _=_ is used for assignment. So to create a variable, you basically choose a name and assign some object to it. For eg:

x = "Goat"
11/2/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, x is a variable. It holds the string _Goat_.
11/2/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A very important aspect of the namespace in python is this: walk with me....
11/2/19, 9:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: x is not actually equal to Goat. Goat is something in the namespace and x points to it. Remember this. It will mean a lot down the line.
11/2/19, 9:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It might not make any sense at the moment but you will remember I said it.
11/2/19, 10:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That said, Python Variables have some recommendations for choosing them.
0. Start all variables with a lower an alphabet not a number. 
1. Variables are required commended to start with a lower case letter.
2. Variables must be a continuous word, no spaces in between.
3. If you will want to use two word use either of 2 conventions:
- join them with an underscore (not a hyphen) _one_list_
or
- write them in camelcase _oneList_
11/2/19, 10:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some names are reserved in python. They include words like _if, in else, elif, for, while, try, except, in, not_ etc. These words are usually highlighted in green by different IDEs.
11/2/19, 10:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: They mean particular things in python and _must_ be used for those things alone. We will see them down the line.
11/2/19, 10:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This will do for variables so far.
Summary:
Make a variable by assignment and assignments in python are done with a single equal sign.
11/2/19, 10:04 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Python (Built-in) Data Types*
11/2/19, 10:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are going to do well with python, you must know what type a variable/data is so you will know what properties it has and what methods it responds to
11/2/19, 10:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Unlike, many languages, Python is dynamically typed.
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This means that, objects in python have explicit types. This is part of why python is easy to write (but a little drag as runtime needs to determine types and so execute a bit slower) Most languages declare what type an object is on creation.

However, since version 3.4 or there about, Python introduced static typing which can be used on demand.

Don't bother about this if it makes no sense now. It will down the line.
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: At this stage, for beginners we are going to concern ourselves with the following data types:
11/2/19, 10:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 10:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Simply put:
_Python string_ type are everyday alphabets a-zA-Z ie capitals or small. This includes some signs.
11/2/19, 10:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: They are written with single or double quotes as a rule. Remember the _x_ variable above that held the string "Goat". Now you know why it is enclosed in quotes.

All strings come with quotes.

Not that x is a variable so can be written without a quote and it will refer to the variable x. However, the variable holds the string _goat_ which must be in quotes.
11/2/19, 10:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The second type is _nunbers_ and pythomg numbers have two types I want us to concern ourselves with:
- _integers_ ie whole numbers: 1,2,33,56,7 etc.
- _floats_ ie numbers with decimal place: 1.0, 4.8, 6.01 etc.
11/2/19, 10:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Forget about complex numbers for now. You'll hardly need them
11/2/19, 10:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will also need to know the _Boolean_ type. This has just two values: true or false.
11/2/19, 10:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To find a python type, use the _type()_ method. Pass the object in the bracket. 

To find the type of our variable x from above, do:

_type(x)_

This will return _class str_ which is a string.
11/2/19, 10:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll stop here.
*Questions*
11/2/19, 10:17 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Boolean true or false should be ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù & ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù the ‚ÄúT‚Äù & ‚ÄúF‚Äù should be uppercase
11/2/19, 10:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Correct.

It's always a capital T and F. Your IDE will show it in a different color.

11/4/19, 6:25 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: @2348036044312
Reading through it I can't find any error. I've not tried to run it for obvious reason. The rest of the code is not available and it would depend on it.

However in I'll point out some things:

When getting things from a form filled in the frontend, unless you are dead sure you have a solid form that can never go wrong, you might wanna get your POST information with a _try/except_ just to be on a safe side since I didn't see you check if the form is valid first. You don't want things breaking there (or anywhere sha) 

1. With this sign up form, you kind of reinvented the wheel. Part of the beauty of Django is that it comes with _batteries_. A builtin Django form would have helped here. There's one at _django.contrib.auth.forms_ you could import the some forms.

That said, it looks like a part of tutorial and the flow of a Django signup is being explained: get POST data from the front, check if email is in use, check if passwords correspond, check if username exists, if it does not, create it, then redirect them to homepage.
11/4/19, 6:29 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Elegantly done. üëç

11/4/19, 8:16 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Hi Pascal.

During the lecture, please assist to educate us on differentiating between list and tuples.
They seem to have same style of bracket.

How do one identify if a sequence is a list or tuple just by looking at it
11/4/19, 8:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip for the week*
This is not really about the python programming language so I beg your pardon. But we can relate to it too.

*History*
For the best of inspiration, read the history of people you admire, that motivate you, that you want to be like.

There's some form of positive kick it gives. You will realize they are normal ordinary human beings who probably did something differently and scored from there. And we can be like them in a form or the other or achieve what they did. They are not ghosts.

So, try reading up about the author of this beautiful language: _Python_. He is _*Guido van Rossum*_. Find out what motivated him and why the name python.
11/4/19, 8:22 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. I will try to remember. But if I don't and you are around just go ahead and chip it in.

By the way _lists_ have square brackets
aList = ["list"] and _tuples_ have the normal bracket
aTuple = ("tuple").

However, maybe you are referring to _dictionaries_ and _sets_ which both are in curly brackets:
dict1 = {"key":"value"}
set1 = {"set"}
11/4/19, 8:22 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Ohh.. Thanks for the clarification..

I appreciate
11/4/19, 8:23 AM - +234 903 182 7815: They don't have same style of brackets. List uses square brackets while tuples uses parenthesis.
11/4/19, 8:24 AM - +234 803 604 4312: @2349081987335 thanks as always. Your advices and notes are always insightful. You are the best. A lovely week ahead. Cheers
11/4/19, 8:24 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Thanks Ribo
11/4/19, 8:25 AM - +234 903 182 7815: Lol.. I am Sam tho.
11/4/19, 8:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üëç
11/4/19, 8:40 AM - +234 803 604 4312: To add tuples: are immutable objects. You can‚Äôt change or edit them. 
List: mutable objects, you can change and edit them. 
Most times to change and edit a tuple, you would have to change its type to either a list 
Eg:  x = (1,2,3)
Converting to a list :-  list(x)
11/4/19, 8:58 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good.

This is why I said everyone (including myself) can always do with a refresher on python lists.

Never gets old.

11/4/19, 3:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Anyone can also tell us what the outcome should be in the case they are convinced its not on the list. It's allowed.
11/4/19, 3:54 PM - +234 815 457 9644: I have to commend @2349081987335 for this teaser. Because of him, I have learnt something new today. For those having doubts about their answer, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7123888/what-is-double-colon-in-numpy-like-in-myarray03?lq=1 should help

11/4/19, 4:07 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Is it ok to talk about the outcome now ?
11/4/19, 4:07 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Nope
11/4/19, 4:07 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Ok then
11/4/19, 4:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's allowed to discuss the answer. So feel free to do so. What will not be appropriate is sharing the result of an actual execution of the code.

 But then to make sure we don't have an undue amount of notifications going out to the members of the group, we are also encouraged to keep our contributions to the barest possible minimum when we can afford to.

If you need to understand something, _there's no limit_ just keep asking. That's the *main aim* of the group.
11/4/19, 4:12 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: Ok
11/4/19, 4:12 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For those who join later, we shared this tip about controlling notifications/alert from this group (and indeed any other Whstaspp group you might be part of).

See it üëá
11/4/19, 4:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Personal Hacking for the Group*

Group notifications are notoriously distracting. To mute this group so you get in when you want, tap the three dots at the top right hand corner and hit _mute notifications_.

11/4/19, 4:23 PM - +234 812 481 1464: I have to comment @2349081987335 for this monday teaser. it's a tricky one
11/4/19, 4:24 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Ok let me just explain my reasoning
11/4/19, 4:24 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It‚Äôs simple and would make it brief
11/4/19, 4:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: The function applied is ‚Äúslicing‚Äù so negative 1 (-1) is simply saying python should print the list from behind
11/4/19, 4:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: That‚Äôs how much I would say
11/4/19, 4:26 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Again the flow of a slice is (start, stop, step)
11/4/19, 4:32 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Sorry, slicing is not a function.
11/4/19, 4:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Method... is that ok now ?
11/4/19, 4:41 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I hope you know the context of ‚Äúmethod/ function‚Äù is debatable depending on how you view it
11/4/19, 4:42 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It‚Äôs termed diff in OOP context as oppose to other type of programming context
11/4/19, 4:42 PM - +234 903 182 7815: It's not even a method sef.
11/4/19, 4:43 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So what is it then ?
11/4/19, 4:45 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Lol... It's just an operation performed on a string, list and tuple. Similar to concatenation and indexing.
11/4/19, 4:48 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Am just aware of this for the first time.... have always known ‚Äúslice() to be a function but what do you know we learn everyday but I stand to be convinced
11/4/19, 4:48 PM - +234 803 604 4312: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_slice.asp
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Is indexing a function?
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I back my up with a general tutorial
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So am waiting for facts to learn
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Remember it‚Äôs a learning process for all
11/4/19, 4:50 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah def!
11/4/19, 4:51 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Index is a built in function too boss
11/4/19, 4:51 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Anything that u use as an operation in any programming language has to be a function either imported or called by default
11/4/19, 4:52 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So educate me boss... am opened to learning
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's neither a _function_ nor a _method_.

It called _comprehension_.
In this case, call it _list comprehension_.
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Not all. Some are object or method.
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yes.
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's neither a _function_ nor a _method_.

It's called _comprehension_.
In this case, call it _list comprehension_.
11/4/19, 5:00 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So why is it defined as a function here ?
11/4/19, 5:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's a syntactic move. It operates by _slicing_ an array in some definite way relative to its _index_.

The important thing is to be aware of them and how they operate.
11/4/19, 5:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That is the _slice()_ method for arrays. It's actually a method. 

It's different from _comprehensions_.
11/4/19, 5:05 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Is this: ([::-1]) different from this slice() ?
11/4/19, 5:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Function vs Method*

For easy differentiation, a  python _method_ is a _function_ defined in a python _class_.

That's a crude definition but it will help us remember the technical difference. When we get there we will try and explain it better.
11/4/19, 5:07 PM - +234 803 604 4312: That‚Äôs why I said the context makes it diff in a situation of OOP
11/4/19, 5:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Great. üëç
11/4/19, 5:20 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah. I get now. Thanks @2349081987335 @2348036044312
11/4/19, 5:22 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I like this... it‚Äôs really a platform for a learning curve... like the teaser was a tricky one thanks again for this paschal!
11/4/19, 5:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have gone into the python documentation.

It appears _comprehensions_ like this are actually python _slice()_ function/method under the hood.

_under the hood_ are my own words here. Lol.

As per doc.python.org, these notations are abridgements of the method _slice()_. However, they come with a syntactic flavor of dropping the _slice_ and skipping the intermediate step where you initialize the slice before calling it on an array.

There are also extended Slicing like I used in the Teaser.

Thanks to the folks that brought up the discussion. Now we all have learnt something new. I have!
11/4/19, 5:32 PM - +234 803 604 4312: No paschal... thank you for a platform for interactive and debate full and also.... a check of your knowledge, and how much u know... We need more of this.... thanks again
11/4/19, 5:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So answer to *Teaser for the day* is B.
11/4/19, 5:34 PM - +234 803 604 4312: U gave us 2 teasers o. Remember ?
11/4/19, 5:34 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok. Right.
11/4/19, 5:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚ùå
A mix up please. Wrong answer.
11/4/19, 5:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Correct answer is option. D.
11/4/19, 5:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This extended _slice_ notation [::-1] does *one* thing to the object it is executed on: it reverses it.

Very powerful builtin function which can come in handy at different times. To build a palindrome, this will be the perfect kicker.
11/4/19, 5:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, correct answer here is option B.
11/4/19, 5:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Line1: we create a set.
Line2: we create another variable and make it point to the things _numbers_ is pointing.
Line3: we mutate the variable from line1 taking only the first two elements. So we have [1,3].
With [::-1] at print, it is reversed to [3,1]
11/4/19, 6:32 PM - +234 706 502 3777: Thank you @2349081987335 for adding me to this group. 
I must confess I have a lot to learn as these commands looks abstract... Lol
11/4/19, 7:04 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Good evening guys, 
Please quick question,  for an individual in the science line (specifically physics),  what area of python application should the person venture into for problems relating to his field of study?
11/4/19, 7:51 PM - +234 905 488 8162: There are so many problems you can solve using python in physics, such as quantum mechanics, python libraries such as quspin, qskit, etc can help u model a complex quantum system using python also generates eign values and functions, there are numerous applications of python in physics, you can download a text book called PYTHON FOR PHYSICIST.
11/4/19, 7:52 PM - +234 705 579 9202: There's a textbook for that? 
Sweet!!

11/4/19, 7:54 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Just query Google you would see varieties of them, and check for  quantum python libraries  , it's an edge because QUANTUM COMPUTING IS BECOMING HOT CAKE .
11/4/19, 7:55 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Thanks boss
11/4/19, 7:58 PM - +234 905 488 8162: You are welcome bro. You can message me privately I would introduce u to some sweet projects using python, recently I used linear regression , RELU activation function to train a data obtained from a simple pendulum experiment and the output proved that period (T^2) is directly proportional to the length of the pendulum. Python is just too much..üòä

You're a physicist too?
11/4/19, 8:01 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Products of Galileo
11/4/19, 8:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Beautiful!
For the record I've never heard of these libraries before but I'm not surprised at bit.

Python is a versatile tool.
Explore. üëç
11/4/19, 8:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'll check them out just to have an overview.
11/4/19, 8:05 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Yes boss Qutip, Qiskit etc , just query quantum libraries in python. Thanks for this platform.üëçüèº
11/4/19, 8:54 PM - +234 706 502 3777: Wow... This is really incredible. Thanks.
What about those in chemistry
11/5/19, 7:17 AM - +234 813 701 6073: And those in Mathematics tooüòü
11/5/19, 10:32 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: There's actually a _math_ module in python.
Go ahead and try it by importing math.

_import math_
_math.pi_ #give you the value of pi for eg
_x = 50_
_math.cos(x) #give you the cos of x_

For the retinue of functions just do
help(math) after you have imported math.
For help with a particular function do _help(math.function)

The _help()_ function is available for every object in python.
11/5/19, 4:06 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Hi guys.

Teaser.

If we cast 2 as a boolean, what will it return?
11/5/19, 4:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You want the *True* - th?
11/5/19, 4:17 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Lol..

I'm just curious. I watched a video where casting of types was discussed.
They used 0 and 1 as examples..

Just curious as to what 2,3 or any other asides 0 and 1 will return
11/5/19, 4:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I actually answered.
The answer is *True*
üòÅ
11/5/19, 4:22 PM - +234 706 527 3604: üòÄüòÄ

Ohh. That's true.. Thanks
11/5/19, 4:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In python, any number that is not zero is significant even if it is a negative number. Zero is in a sense _insignificant_ and so wouldn't count for anything. That's why casting it to Bool will return *False*.

11/7/19, 7:03 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, for the more experienced folk in here I have a Teaser.
11/7/19, 7:04 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 7:06 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Remember, _in this script_; not generally in python.
11/7/19, 8:36 AM - +234 701 291 2307: g1 wasn't declared
11/7/19, 8:47 AM - Ogbosho Tupac: I am lost in this one oo
11/7/19, 8:53 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Counting too (I am not really sure)

(index, value) 
I = index

11/7/19, 10:01 AM - +234 803 604 4312: enumerate():- iterates through a list in context which is ‚Äúg1‚Äù
11/7/19, 10:01 AM - +234 803 604 4312: You are correct (index, value)

4. Value etc
11/7/19, 10:11 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: As far as the screenshot goes, *CORRECT*. But it was declared somewhere before line 1. Not yet an answer to the question per se.
11/7/19, 10:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Your 911 is here üòâ

11/7/19, 10:13 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True... but....
11/7/19, 10:14 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True but that's what the *Teaser* says not to bother about as it is a given on the use of enumerate()
11/7/19, 10:14 AM - +34 689 00 06 09: me too...completely lost ooo
11/7/19, 10:15 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True but that's what the *Teaser* says not to bother about as it is a given on the use of enumerate()
11/7/19, 10:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, it is a trick question. That's what  *Teasers* are about.
11/7/19, 10:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: All who answered on the use of _enumerate()_ are correct. Well, except those that we have called 911 on.
11/7/19, 10:19 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Answer*
_enumerate()_ is completely useless in that script. I mean 100%. If it's removed, it will still work.
*Another Teaser*
Can anyone figure out why or give a reason why this is true, if it is. (But I tell you it is).
11/7/19, 10:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Look at the script screenshot again.
11/7/19, 10:21 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 10:25 AM - +234 812 053 1560: üí™i really wish this translates to my current knowledge ranking in python on the group...lol
11/7/19, 10:28 AM - +234 803 604 4312: True, it would work without the enumerate(). But if you index to do numbering for the result from the loop then the better use would be with the enumerate(). If not that then you would have to have a counter variable to do the numbering. 

I = 0 
for variable in(g1): 
       ......

11/7/19, 10:45 AM - +234 816 398 2854: So... you already have the data of everyone chatting on the group. 
Awesome, nice application of data
11/7/19, 10:46 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol.
Keep moving you will get there. Your tenacity is _noteworthy_.

11/7/19, 10:50 AM - +234 903 881 9790: How did you scrawl thid data from here?
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True.
Enumerate is pain-free but with a counter it's more manual however it gives more flexibility to the developer to do different things.
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - +234 903 881 9790: You followed @2349081987335
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - +234 816 398 2854: He needs to tell us
11/7/19, 10:51 AM - +234 701 291 2307: I think he exported the chat
11/7/19, 10:51 AM - +234 817 044 9056: My question too
11/7/19, 10:52 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So the clue here is that _i_ is the variable holding the index running with _enumerate()_. Notice that it is used _nowhere_ after it was initialized. So it's a _waste_. The machine does one less job by not holding the index numbering in memory.
11/7/19, 10:52 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üôá
11/7/19, 10:53 AM - +234 903 881 9790: Teavh us this @2349081987335 

üôåüôåüôåüôå
11/7/19, 10:54 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: @2347012912307 has answered. I simply exported the chat.

Tap the three dots at the top right hand corner, tap *more*, and then *export chat*.
11/7/19, 10:55 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: @2348170449056 and @2348163982854 I hope you now know. You can do it too.
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - +234 903 881 9790: Good.

Coupled with some technical skills you will teach us.

Exporting the chat won't turn to chart
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - +234 816 398 2854: He used python for data analysis
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - +234 816 398 2854: I understand what he did. 
Just wanted to know how he got the data
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hehe.
Even better, I will share the whole notebook.

Part of the perks of being in here is access to scripts I make public or members make a request of and it is not too private to give out.
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - +234 816 398 2854: And then turned it to csv, files
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Thank you so much.

11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Next up, I will have a summary of our different locations as we participated in the #AskFeshIntro

I've done it halfway but there was a lot of noise in between so it is asking for way more cleaning that I can afford time for.

Anyone interested in cleaning it out further can do so when I share the repository.
11/7/19, 11:33 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: As promised

11/7/19, 11:49 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
When the group first started, I asked members to write their preferred name and location with a tag so I can collect it and let us see an infograph of our spread. But some added some other things apart from their name and location making it tricky (so needing more time to clean) to analyse.
That's what I am saying that someone could try to clean it up to get the needed info only: names and location.

I already have all the tweets bearing the intro tag in a csv file in the repository shared some moments ago.

11/7/19, 12:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So for the rest of us in here beginners, don't bother too much about anything that looks or sounds too fancy doesn't make sense yet. In as little as 2 months with a few hours a week, you will get to understand most of what transpires with the rest that are past the  beginning stages.
11/7/19, 12:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: On this note let me announce the next event.

Last time we looked at data types. I encourage you to read those parts up for a refresher at w3schools.com/python.
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We already have one lined up. I wonder how I forgot.
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I wanted to bring all beginners up to speed.

Back in the day, my confusion was *where can I write the code itself and how can I execute it*

I'm considering having this replace what we have scheduled already because it is a part one needs to do in order to stand a good chance of advancing.

If you are studying/learning with just taking note and trying to memorize, you will be surprised how true it is that *you don't know what you are doing*.
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: Sth like this
11/7/19, 1:06 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: I know i am a core beginner
11/7/19, 1:06 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: But that comment up @fesh is worrying me
11/7/19, 1:12 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will sort it this Saturday.

Get ready all of you starters:

- Have your laptop or PC ready.
- Install python on your computer. Find practical directions in this article:üëá
Setting Up Python for Data Analysis
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-python-data-analysis-amah-paschal-chukwuemeka

- download and install Anaconda or, when you finish the step above, with internet connected to your laptop, open a command prompt and type

_pip install jupyter notebook_

Hit enter.

Please get these done or ask for directions to get it done so that by Saturday we can write code and execute it together.
11/7/19, 1:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Saturday after Nov 9, we will have a Zoom meeting. I will share the meeting invite next week.

It will be an opportunity to see and hear me guide you through the absolute beginnings live. You will see my desktop (not me) and hear me speak, show and explain.

Get ready. Download zoom on your desktop or on your mobile to join in.

I checked it out
11/7/19, 2:13 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Quick question @2349081987335. How and why did you clean the chat history txt file into 50 rows of data in the csv format?
I am only curious
11/7/19, 3:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üëç
11/7/19, 3:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You deleted this message
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I noticed that too. Are we just 50 in this group? Let me check...
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For every line of the cleaned chat, I looked for those that had the word "intro" in it and isolated them.

This is why I requested folks joining in to use the tag #AskFeshIntro. I could have used it exactly but I found some used f *r* esh instead of Fesh so I decided to go with intro alone.
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Ermmmmm.
So you only analyzed the introduction alone?
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Only around that number engaged in the _intro dance_
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No. I extended the analysis to all chats for the graph that features in the notebook.
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - +234 816 398 2854: So you used the chats with the keyword *"intro"* in them. 

So others that didn't really join in with that hash tag didn't get to be part of the analysis structure ü§®ü§î


I see
11/7/19, 3:10 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Yeah I understand sir
11/7/19, 3:10 PM - +234 816 398 2854: I could see that.

11/7/19, 4:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Exporting it from here dumps it in that format.
11/7/19, 4:16 PM - +234 812 481 1464: Oh thanks.... I didnt know that
11/7/19, 4:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk.
Our job here is to answer questions so more of us will know.
Don't hold any back. üëç
11/8/19, 5:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello good people.

I'm unavoidably absent this weekend so the scheduled meet for tomorrow will no longer hold.

The inconvenience is deeply regretted. We shall pick up from next week.

Questions will still be answered as they come.

11/11/19, 8:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For this weekend, instead of catching up the missed topic of last weekend, I think we should still go ahead with the planned Zoom meeting.

It is paramount that we give all you need that clarity, what is required to do to be able to write our own code, save it and be already to run it.

If that's the only practical thing you take away from this group, get ready for this weekend. You will be surprised how straightforward it is.
11/11/19, 8:22 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Sir... let's brush Newbies so that they can follow suite please
11/11/19, 8:22 AM - +234 806 235 5136: My humble request
11/11/19, 8:22 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In due time then. ‚úåÔ∏è
11/11/19, 8:23 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's my thought too.
The meeting is to make sure absolute beginners can set up and run code be they during events or some of the teasers we share from time to time.

I want everybody here who wants to, to be able not only to read up but be able to write python code.
11/11/19, 8:25 AM - +234 706 502 3777: I will really appreciate this... I'm in this category oo
11/11/19, 8:25 AM - +234 706 502 3777: I want to learn Python for data analysis first... I have installed Python and atom
11/11/19, 8:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's very fine. We all were here at a point. We'll do our best to carry you along.
11/11/19, 8:28 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Thanks
11/11/19, 8:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are yet to, remember to to follow this guide üëÜto install and test that it's well done.

Then also install Anaconda if you have enough data. It's around 300MB. If that's a lot on your budget, after installing and testing python as in the guide above, connect to the internet, open _command prompt_ and type
*pip install jupyter notebook*

It will download just the things you need to run jupyter notebook from the command line. I am recommending it for beginners and for all who are looking to do data analytics/science.
11/11/19, 8:30 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Awesome
11/11/19, 9:08 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Last week my printer wanted me to help him generate pins and serial number for 1000 scratch cards he's making for me for the school year.

I thought to make a python script that automatically creates integer PINs and corresponding serial.

It makes 1000 PINs and serials starting from 001. It asks for the length of PIN you want, generates them, then asks for a name to save it with, does so and opens the folder the file was saved in.

https://github.com/ifebuche/PIN-Serial-Generator

This is a practical thing you can do. Can you think of ways to make the script create more than 1000? Play around with the code. Ask questions if you will to understand it more.
11/11/19, 9:10 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have the code in an ipython notebook as well as a dot py file. We will use both as demo this weekend when we Zoom.

You will see how to run a python script/code/program.
11/11/19, 9:28 AM - Ogbosho Tupac: That will be great

11/11/19, 1:47 PM - +234 815 457 9644: I want to loop over the list_of_pages list, feeding the two inputs from that list into the drop_rate function I wrote
11/11/19, 1:48 PM - +234 815 457 9644: do you mean for ind, value...? If so, No, it means for index, value (i.e position, and value)
11/11/19, 1:59 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Line 4. You're saying next_val = value[next_index]

So, the value here, is it a function
11/11/19, 2:01 PM - +234 815 457 9644: No it isn't
Oh I see what u mean
11/11/19, 2:02 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Ohh.. Yeah..

Nice one üôÇ
11/11/19, 2:03 PM - +234 815 457 9644: So I see the problem, I'm trying to index a value, treating a value like a list, that won't work
11/11/19, 2:03 PM - +234 815 457 9644: The question is, what is the solution
I don't want to use two loops
11/11/19, 2:04 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Next_index, is it a value? Like an integer of float?
11/11/19, 2:09 PM - +234 815 457 9644: In the list, there are 5 integer values
I want to pass them into a function like this

Loop one: my_function(val_1, val_2)
Loop two:
my_funtion(val_2, val_3)
Loop three:
my_function(val_3, val_4)

Etc
11/11/19, 2:14 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Instead of value, use int.

See if it will run and if that will suffice
11/11/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _ind_ is running your index of 1-n and _value_ is taking the members of the _iterable_ names _listOfTable_ which appears to be made of of integers. If it is true that it is made up of integers, then that explains the type error you are getting as you are trying to subscribe to an integer. So you yet a TypeError. You can only subscribe to an array.

When you says (on line 4 where the error is)
_next_val = value[next_value]_, for the first iteration what is happening is something like this:

_next_value = 5[1]_

5 is an integer and you can't subscribe/index into it. TypeError occurs.
11/11/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: What do you want to achieve so we see what will work for you.
11/11/19, 4:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
Let's see...

11/11/19, 4:04 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is a prime candidate for _map()_

Do this:
_[map(function, list)]_
11/11/19, 4:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. Nice. üëç
11/11/19, 6:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: With more detail on what is needed here, map won't work here.

_map()_ is suited for executing a function over an iterable.

Eg:

11/12/19, 11:21 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Morning guys sorry I was missed the help task yesterday.... was a long day..... glad you finally figured it out.... but likewise, it‚Äôs good to know what was wrong in the code if noticed.... looking at ‚ÄúIn 53‚Äù : using the enumerator method in your for loop... 
the position of the ‚Äúind‚Äù is the loop using the enumerator method automatically counts your iteration... hence there was no need for the ‚Äúind + 1‚Äù the program would do automatic increments and count for you using the enumerator method. 

Line 4: definitely has a int in the mix. Since the full code can‚Äôt be seen that most likely the reason for the error
11/12/19, 12:07 PM - +234 816 398 2854: wow, how does this work?
11/12/19, 12:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: He's found a working way out. üëç
11/12/19, 12:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have a function you want to execute on a collection, use _map()_.

In the example, we have a list of figures each corresponding to the radius of a circle and we have a function _area_circle_ that calculated the circumference of a circle.

Instead of using a for loop to call the function on each of the members, map can takes the function and the list as arguments and perform as the function on each member of the list.

The result is a map object (saving memory) which can be unpacked with the _list()_ method.

I printed the map object first and then unpacked it with _list()_

11/13/19, 8:50 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _*Meanwhile for the _Zoom Meeting this weekend*_:

Paschal Amah is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
*Topic*: #AskFeshPy Meeting 0
*Time*: Nov 16, 2019 10:00 PM West Central Africa
*Join Zoom Meeting Link:*
https://zoom.us/j/434878697?pwd=MHJZTllDbFVhUjN3eHYraDZEb2dNUT09
Meeting ID: 434 878 697
*Password*: _will be published 12hrs to start time_
11/13/19, 9:49 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some interesting resumes have come in. Many thanks. 

We should have had this group earlier than now. I've got requests and openings I was not able to fill but hopefully as they come I will now have recommendations. Permit me to keep all I have got in the kitty. Even if this one does not invite you, once you are open, I will be sending them out hoping folks get a placing from here.

I have opened some and have recommended some updates to them. If  I did with yours and you have the time, please do, for better chances. For technical people like me, I know what I am looking for but we cannot say this for the HR folks who look for what they look for. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

If you have a github account, add it to your profile and of course LinkedIn. One of your github pages was interesting I had to fork a repo there, hoping I will have time to study it.

Best regards.
11/13/19, 9:51 AM - Adafin: Thanks fesh... Great work!
11/13/19, 9:52 AM - Adafin: We at basic learning levels too are open.. we however has strong excel and visualization skills. 

Python is the one remaining üòÅ
11/13/19, 9:52 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: My general observation.
In case you didn't know, you can start your CV with your work experience and your education.
If you know you are heavier on the work experience department, start with it!
11/13/19, 9:53 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sure bro.
Different openings require different skills. Hopefully one similar to yours will show up.
11/13/19, 9:55 AM - Chigozie Njoku D-GASM: Hi Fesh, please what's your take on SAS as regards data analytics?
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - Adafin: üôåüèªüëç
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - +234 818 847 1990: Thanks @2349081987335 For this platform and the opportunities that have come and are still coming from it.
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: SAS is a great tool. However it is closed source. Call it proprietary. Compared to open source tools like Python, it will have much less job openings. However, some organisations use it and I have seen postgraduate courses in data analytics offer it.
11/13/19, 9:58 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *PS*
If you know you do not have the requirements for a role, don't bother sending in a note. When it comes to your skills you will know. Many thanks. Meanwhile keep building your skills.
11/13/19, 10:01 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you feel you do not have work experience because you have not been employed for a while, see it this. It is an opportunity for you to take on projects you think an employer will fancy to see on your resume. Take them on, open a github account and have a record of them. It might appear too much of a task now but believe me, two years from now is still another tomorrow and you will look back and wonder why you didn't start.

Start now. It's the best time.
And make sure you are having fun doing it because that makes it easier. If you are not, may be you are in the wrong area?
11/13/19, 10:31 AM - +234 803 604 4312: I have always been glad for this platform and initiative. What you have started and embarked on is of great use.... and if managed well, can change the paradigm. 
Also, there are some of us that would be opened to part-time jobs, remotes jobs and projects that we might be interested in and able to do. I worked for 5month remotely for a us company. So it‚Äôs a good initiative and concept you can propose and push too.... that‚Äôs what the Andela engine room is built on.... and you could be the pioneer for python as our leader.... lol.... 

Enjoy your day
11/13/19, 10:36 AM - +234 703 120 1331 changed the subject from "#AskPyFesh " to "#AskPyFesh"
11/13/19, 10:48 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No doubt bro.

I will look at the remote opportunities too. It's such an integral part of having coding skills. Personally I'm not the 9-5 fan. I prefer timed deliverables. I don't care if you show up or not unless there's a physical session needed by the nature of the moment. What I insist on is delivery quality and on time. However, that's not what all companies want. Some want to see the guy they are paying sitting down with them even if they are doing nothing. Funny by sad.

So, yes. From remote gigs to projects by me and some senior colleagues, I will try and share them so that the beginners and those short on experience will fill the gap.

Ideas are always welcome.

11/13/19, 11:07 AM - +234 903 895 4127: Copied
11/13/19, 11:12 AM - +234 803 604 4312: I totally understand. There‚Äôs still a big lag on the concept of tech jobs in Nigeria. Most especially for programmers and analyst. You need an enabling and comfortable space to do your thing. That‚Äôs why if you visit the major big tech companies it‚Äôs not like your conventional work environment. No programmer or analyst knows it all.... but the key thing is know how to get the resource to get the job done. The mistake employers make is thinking sitting and putting a tab on you makes the work get done. Which is a no. Microsoft for instance did a 4 working days test and performance jumped up 40%. I know for a fact that modern company support the culture of one day out of the 5days you work from home. It is a culture. We really have a lot to be enlightened on.
11/13/19, 11:18 AM - +234 805 326 3849: I am in on this, pls
11/13/19, 12:01 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Please help the web developers in here also.
11/13/19, 12:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will get there. Don't worry.
I'm a web developer too so I can handle some decent stuff there.
I presume you work with python. What framework are you using, Django, Flask, Bottle?
11/13/19, 12:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many thanks all.
This window is now *Closed*.

I will forward the CV and they will select two from the list as I was made to understand.
Rgds.
11/13/19, 12:38 PM - +234 815 457 9644: Thanks
11/13/19, 3:43 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Thanks Paschal for all your efforts. I am truly inspired by this selfless kind gesture. And to all who participate here whether beginner or programming Ninja we can come together as one and make this platform a great place if we continue to act in oneness and utmost humility.
I appreciate you all for your inputs especially while learning and let's keep the group alive!
Keep learning! #levelup

11/14/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, I am going to revoke the join link of this group and it will be mostly permanent.
11/14/19, 4:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is because after this Saturday, we cannot afford to take on absolute beginners again as we must have passed what they will require. Till further notice.

We will only let in people who are on the journey already so we don't take ourselves backwards and distract are forward movement.
11/14/19, 4:01 PM - +234 706 514 6514: Okay Great
11/14/19, 4:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For the latest entrants, we have a live Zoom meeting coming up this weekend on Saturday.

To join in, be prepared by downloading Zoom (Cloud meeting) on your PC or mobile so you can join.
11/14/19, 4:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Features*
- Participants will see a portion or all parts of the host's (my) computer as I show us stuff.
- Participants will hear the host presenting.
- I have set the meeting to disable the audio of all participants as they join so we don't end up at with an Oshodi (üòÅ). (for our non-Nigerian co-learners, that's a rowdy place in Lagos.)
- Participants can send a message to the group (those present in the meeting) or directly to the host. The options will show at your respective end.
- Any participant that wants to ask a question will need to send it as a msg to the host. I will keep an eye on the area for questions. If you want to speak, indicate and I will turn on your audio.

Sadly, we can only go 40 minutes before the free version stops the meeting.

*On joining the meeting* you will be asked to choose a name.

You can join whether you created a Zoom account already or not. You just need to have it installed.

You can enter the meeting ahead of the host if you so desire.

There are other features but these are the ones I want us to note.

In future we can participant and code together by the host ceding access to a participant to type.

*Questions* if any.

Link to the scheduling meeting coming right up. üëá

If you were wondering how to start writing python code and saving it and running it. 
You have seen it now.

This is the very beginning of everything.
You want to work with Andela, Turing or be your own private consultant or work in any other firm with this skill, you are set to start exploring and learning. A good resource is w3schools.com/python, DataCamp and SoloLearn.

Good luck.

11/17/19, 12:53 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I think there are some dependencies you need to install in addition on your pydroid format to work
11/17/19, 12:53 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Yes
11/17/19, 12:54 PM - +234 705 579 9202: QT loader?

11/17/19, 12:55 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Thanks 
I'd be waiting üôèüôèüôè
11/17/19, 1:10 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Your code looks good.... it‚Äôs obviously the dependencies.  Or something more
11/17/19, 1:11 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Chill, does it have it installed via pip?
11/17/19, 1:12 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I think he said he has it installed already via pip
11/17/19, 1:12 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Pydroid has its inbuilt pip installer
11/17/19, 1:13 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Check if you have PyQt5
11/17/19, 1:13 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Go to your libraries
11/17/19, 1:17 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Also check for pyparsing and ensure you have numpy too
11/17/19, 1:20 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I do bruh
11/17/19, 1:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I've not used Pydroid a lot.

Let me take a shot and see what could be the hold up since it had pip. From one of the screenshot, it *could* be the device in question does not have enough memory to handle.
11/17/19, 1:23 PM - +234 803 604 4312: You are very correct.... how did I miss that. If all dependencies are in place and you have the 32bit runtime error then it‚Äôs more of an internal memory thing
11/17/19, 1:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Also, ensure you are using QT5.11
11/17/19, 1:25 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay I'd check my internal storage
11/17/19, 1:26 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I've tried installing that, 
I don't know where to get it, 
Playstore isn't showing anything
11/17/19, 1:27 PM - +234 803 604 4312: You would need to install that via ‚Äúpip‚Äù that would be run in python. So it‚Äôs not a play store thing
11/17/19, 1:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hm.
This Pydroid is really useful.

So, this is what I figured out from my little test.

You don't need _PyQT_ to make a plot. At least I didn't need to install it. I figured it had no place in the sample code so I went ahead without it.

If your issue persists it might be either of _compiler_ or _memory_ issues.

A fix might be u installing Pydroid and it's pip extension if it doesn't go with Pydroid then do a fresh install.
11/17/19, 1:41 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: uninstalling*
11/17/19, 2:04 PM - +234 803 929 4506: Could someone please run me through installing pyroid on an iPhone. I couldn‚Äôt find any clear instructions online
11/17/19, 2:10 PM - +234 803 929 4506: Found an app on the App Store. Python3IDE. Have a system but wouldn‚Äôt mind learning / coding on the go.
11/17/19, 2:10 PM - +234 803 929 4506: Anyone used this before?
11/17/19, 2:15 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a pydroid or any ide for python on IOS. I tried searching too one time but couldn‚Äôt find anything concrete

11/17/19, 2:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Pydroid doesn't seem to have an offering for iOS devices.

_Pythonista_ is advertised. Can someone on iOS give it a shot.

11/17/19, 5:01 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Data scientists /analysts in the house, please I would like to know how you analyze questionnaire data
11/17/19, 5:02 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Most especially the one presented on likert scale
11/17/19, 5:03 PM - +234 816 440 2922: I'll be glad to get help here because I'm new to data analysis
11/17/19, 5:06 PM - +234 903 881 9790: Well.

I know spss can handle this well.

But hope python gurus in the house can open our eyes .
11/17/19, 5:22 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I read sometime ago how to create quiz questions and answers using classes, if statements and loops as such it would be possible to analyse same with python but I will leave this to my oga(s) at the top for a more suited answer per analysing questionnaire data.
11/17/19, 5:27 PM - +234 906 883 7990: Likert scale data is mostly categorical. You can use OHE or Label encoding to encode your data for EDA. Then you can standardize for your model or dimension reduction. That's how I'd go about it.
11/17/19, 5:51 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Sir I'll be glad if this can be practicalise in a more step wise order
11/17/19, 7:03 PM - +234 906 883 7990: This message was deleted
11/17/19, 7:04 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It is actually possible to create multiple quiz questions and answer in python using the class object. I have seen it done can whip up the code for you if you want when I have sometime to spare
11/17/19, 7:08 PM - +234 906 883 7990: 1. Do your EDA
2. Depending on the model you want to, for instance if it's Clustering, label encode the data, then you standardise.
3. Instantiate your clustering algorithm.
11/17/19, 7:21 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I have done something on that before. I used for loops and if statement. Although, I also made the stuff random. I made the questions randomly generated.
11/17/19, 7:21 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I created different list for the questions and answers.
11/17/19, 7:27 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I have a question

Thoughts on having a GitHub account?
11/17/19, 7:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: What can be done depends a lot on the data type and what insights are sought.
11/17/19, 7:36 PM - +234 806 235 5136: JS na
11/17/19, 7:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Github and git are a life saver. We _will_ look at it for developers in here.
11/17/19, 7:39 PM - +234 806 235 5136: I tot for loop and if statement is found only in JavaScript
11/17/19, 7:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Most things you find in one programming language are there in a way in all others especially the basic building blocks. All loops are basic and ubiquitous.
11/17/19, 7:46 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Someone here please
11/17/19, 7:54 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Not at all. It's an essential structure of a programming language. It's found in any and every programming language.
11/17/19, 7:56 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah. It's important to have a Github account. 

It allows for easy accessibility of your projects.
11/17/19, 9:43 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Can I pm?
11/17/19, 9:53 PM - +234 906 883 7990: Yeah
11/18/19, 11:19 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you
11/18/19, 9:26 PM - +234 805 326 3849: It was a regret that I missed the zoom meeting after several days of preparation. All the same, I hope never to miss the next meeting and kudos to paschal for his effort
11/19/19, 6:36 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No problem.
The link to the video is shared.
11/19/19, 8:06 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good morning good people.
11/19/19, 8:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It has been mostly silent from my end.

No tips and no teasers. They will resume shortly. I have been on a project trying to push it to production in a few days. It's been a solo project and as I haven't had hands to help, it's been on and off. 

Let me invite you to please take a look and critique it for me. Frontend development is not my forte but don't try me on backend/server-side. üòÅ

This is the temporary link it is sitting on:

fesh.pythonanywhere.com/shop

Please sign up and have a feel around. You can go as far as making a purchase with the *test* card. If you give me some feedback it will be greatly appreciated.

The picture quality are a bit low. I'm aware and working on new product pictures.

11/19/19, 10:01 AM - +234 803 604 4312: So I checked out your link.... and it looks good for a man that claims his ‚Äúfrontend dev‚Äù isn‚Äôt a forte. But honestly, looks real good. I check it on my mobile and the templates used didnt clash or overlay each other..... maybe more alignment would make it better(mobile view). But if it‚Äôs good on mobile.... then the finish line is in view. 
One question, what was it built on ? Django, HTML&CSS, JS or WP ?
11/19/19, 10:05 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Wow, I want to get to this level too.
It's pretty creative tho
11/19/19, 10:11 AM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: After signing up, and picking a product, I needed to sign in again and reselect the product before it's added to cart.

I noticed that the slide pictures when clicked prompts nothing and does not load.

My observations.
11/19/19, 10:18 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Who is here in Oriental hotel for the DSN AI conference..... let's identify...we could all meet atleast for the first time ..

11/19/19, 10:27 AM - +234 806 235 5136: That's nice Bro....
I hope to get to this next....but just to make some queries... I suggest the user interface should be worked on....to make it more glowming and easy/friendly to use

11/19/19, 10:29 AM - +234 812 053 1560: Is it open for all to attend. I thought it was based on a pre qualification from a challenge?
11/19/19, 10:29 AM - +234 812 053 1560: I would have loved to attend
11/19/19, 10:30 AM - +234 803 929 4506: Free for all. What you mention, That‚Äôs a separate challenge.
11/19/19, 10:30 AM - +234 803 929 4506: Same organization though.
11/19/19, 10:30 AM - +234 803 929 4506: The other is a bootcamp based on prequalification.
11/19/19, 10:31 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Thanks man.
Server-side is 100% Django
Front is a riot üòÅ: mostly boostrap and some extensive custom CSS then ekko-lightbox, fesh etc. You don't wanna know. I hope to do better at the front or totally ignore it. 

Alignment needs work no doubt. Thanks. 
I developed mobile first. More than 80% of users today are mobile. I have proof, lol.

Many thanks. ‚úå

Hope there will be more opportunities. Otherwise we create one ourselves.
11/19/19, 10:35 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ü§£
True.
Thing is, this is a pro bono work and before you get somebody to do free job it's like asking that Nigeria turns to London. But yea, that is an option always that's why I said I either get better at it or simple toss it.
11/19/19, 10:35 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Thanks man. ‚úå

It's something one can learn anyway.

11/19/19, 10:39 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It does.
I'm still on it as I type.
11/19/19, 10:40 AM - Adafin: That great. I trust your zeal to get things done anyway. It unprecedented.
11/19/19, 10:40 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Thanks.
I made sure to see that it is _swift_. I hate slow stuff. Impacts users experience negatively.
It is mobile first so everything is expected to line up on mobile.
11/19/19, 10:41 AM - Adafin: Yes it is.. I saw the experience with how items are selected into cart and the check outs. It is swift
11/19/19, 10:41 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Tankio.
11/19/19, 10:42 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's the plan. ‚úå
11/19/19, 10:46 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hm.
Thanks!

I'll look at that.
Usually after sign up you are required to log in. So that's kind of expected.

The slide at the home page or at the products page? At the products page it show pop up a larger picture. Larger pix not loaded up at the back anyway, but it should pop up what it has at the moment.
Many thanks for the feedback.

11/19/19, 9:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A good coding question will always include what you want to achieve and a sample of what you have tried and the error message.

The sample is here but the error message is not and what you intend to achieve is missing (though the snippet here is clear enough to decipher it).

You are mixing up indentation. Python is sensitive to whitespace at the start of lines.
11/19/19, 9:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That said
11/19/19, 9:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first four lines are a _function_. The first line of every function ends with a colon so all the remainder of the function should have a consistent indent (whitespace) at their beginning. Choose a number and stick to it. The standard practice is 4 spaces or just use your tab key on the keyboard.

Once the indentation is added, skip a line for some semantic touch/readability so it becomes obvious that the function has ended, then finish up the rest of the lines starting them from the beginning, ie, giving no space at the beginning as they are not part of the _function_.
11/19/19, 10:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The print statement is ok.

11/19/19, 10:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The line I struck through is actually doing nothing in the script so it's ok to drop it. That first part, the function, is where the issue is.

Notice how all the lines below the _def_ keyword line have a consistent space (4) at the beginning. That was the issue.

If you check the primary aim of this group you will see that it is learning through asking questions.


Don't hesitate to ask anytime you have one. You will learn and the rest of us will leant too.

11/19/19, 10:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The correct answer here is _d_

Partition takes at least one argument. What it does is that it takes a variable produces a 3 item tuple by splits it into three parts.

_index 0_ is the first part, and comprises everything before the argument in the _partition(arg)_.
_index 1_ the argument in the _partition(arg)_
_index 2_ is everything after the argument in _partition(arg)_

In the exercise, _aPoint_ is the argument which is the 3rd element of the variable _test_ ie 'architect'.

When you partition test at _architects_, you have:
_index 0_ as *we are the*
_index 1_ as *architects*
_index 2_ as *of our life*

Combined with regex, the partition method will do wonders for you in NLP.

11/20/19, 4:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip for the day*
A good coding question comprises of three parts:

0. What you are trying to achieve.
1. What you have done in attempt to get this done.
2. What error you are encountering (if any) or what you are you getting that is not what you wanted/expected.

1 and 2 will usually involve a screenshot of the code and result. 

These will assist a helper towards getting a definite solution(s) for you.

Non-beginners should look at it and figure out what is happening. Beginners, look at it and see if you can figure out a line you understand perfectly what it is doing.

11/20/19, 5:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For beginners, do it this way.

The python function up there (_word_distribution(string)_) is expecting an argument _string_ which is the sentence or article you want to run it on.

eg:
test_sentence = "How many, , many how - , many time, can you many times 'the many time'. Sorry but I sorry sir."

11/20/19, 6:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Can I presume that you want them to keep entering movie names until they enter the word 'exit' and the script ends?

11/20/19, 6:51 PM - +234 705 579 9202: No. I want them to enter their movie names,  but if along the way they enter "quit" then the program stops,

11/20/19, 10:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm assuming the range you put in is an attempt to make the user not exceed first inputs.

I have used counter to take care of that.

The flow is, ask for an input. Provided it is not _exit_, add it to the list of movies, increment _counter_ by one and keep doing so till it gets to 5 at which point you print the movies entered so far and break out of the loop. But if it is _exit_ that is entered, print the movies you have and then break out of the _while_ loop.
11/20/19, 10:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Erm,... you said quit, I don't know why I keep using exit. My bad. But we could as well use _gala_ if you get me, lol.

If you have just come join the group, warm welcome.

We are probably closing the door temporarily. This is in an effort to try and drive learning for absolute beginners forward and not get drawn back indefinitely. At least until we can open our doors and again for a new cycle of sorts.

Meeting ID: 727 941 856
11/21/19, 6:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are going to do this, you will need your own laptop for learning and practice. 

To be ready, you have to install python on your computer and the recommended IDE for us is the jupyter notebook.

To make things easier, I will ask that you download and install Anaconda on your PC. It comes with python and the jupyter notebook. 

Get it here:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Get latest version (3.7 at the moment). 
There are 32 and 64 bit versions. Get the one that corresponds with your OS version. If in doubt, get 32bit.

At installation, *remember* to add conda to *PATH*. Check that button. This is critical. It will throw a red flag but don't mind it, continue.

To test that you installed it correctly, open a command prompt and type _python_ and hit enter. If you get no error, you are good to go. If you do, you didn't check to add it to PATH. Uninstall and install again. Check the button to add to PATH. 

PS: Anaconda is large. You will need at least 500MB or 0.5GB to get it.
11/22/19, 9:47 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: As we head towards _Zoom Meet 1_, beginners will do well do refer to this video of the last meet to see how to get up to speed and follow us:

11/22/19, 12:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I don't know if there are any Django developers in here but I have a tip for them for the day.
11/22/19, 12:32 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip of the Day*
Django humanize

The python web framework that comes with batteries packed, Django, has a set of template filters useful for adding a ‚Äúhuman touch‚Äù to data.

To activate them, add 'django.contrib.humanize' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting. Once done, use {% load humanize %} in templates you want to apply them and you‚Äôll have access to the following filters:

_apnumber - (returns 1-9 spelled out otherwise returns the number) - 1 becomes one and 10 becomes 10._
_intcomma - 4500 becomes 4,500 (for ints, floats or their string format)_.
_intword - 1000000 becomes 1.0 million._
_naturalday - 21 Nov 2019 becomes yesterday. (Going by today's date)_
_naturaltime - 22 Nov 2019 12:22:30 becomes now. (Going by actual time I typed this)_
_ordinal - 1 becomes 1st._

Example applications. I wanted commas in the price total of my products so it went from
{{ order.shipping_cost }} which returned returns/displays 1500.00
to
{{ order.shipping_cost|intcomma }} which returns 1,500.00

These can be very handy for django developers.
11/22/19, 1:23 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Wow.. Thanks.
11/22/19, 1:23 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Do I need to pip install it from cmd?
11/22/19, 1:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It comes with Django and can only be used in Django. Call it a class/method within Django. 

If you are using pandas for example it is like talking about groupby().
11/22/19, 1:52 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Ok
11/22/19, 9:13 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Hello bosses,  pls
Is there any difference between python pandas and SQL?
11/22/19, 9:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea..A sea of difference actually. Might be a bit hard to detail all of it.

And yes there are several similarities.
11/22/19, 9:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/34357/why-do-people-prefer-pandas-to-sql

11/22/19, 9:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Summary:
SQL is the structured query language for database creation and manipulation.

Pandas is a Python library that deals with dataframes. Dataframes are tables and databases are essentially tables too.

The advantage of pandas would be ease of learning curve compared to SQL that can get complex real fast. Moreso, pandas can extract, transform and load (ETL) data. Python can query SQL databases (see Sqlalchemy etc) too. SQL can't touch python, well mostly. 

For purely database applications, SQL will be way more versatile as that is what it lives for. It can also do some analytics if the user has advanced knowledge.

11/25/19, 8:09 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Awesome!

Any luck with the video of the last Zoom meeting, please?üò¨üôà
11/25/19, 8:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea. About that.
Unfortunately, I can't find any video. What happened was that I had auto record in the first video if that night and when I had to restart the meeting, I did not use that neither did I manual start the recording. That's the only thing that could have happened.

Yes I had my back video (desktop capture) on but apparently, once the mic is engaged by an app, it cannot pick sounds. So I have that back up video but it has non audio to go with. ü§∑

Very unfortunate I must say. This is a video that would have been a big refresher and reference for beginners.
11/25/19, 8:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'll be more attentive next time to my settings.

Apologies to all that banked on getting the video. It was a village people moment. I'll make better plans next time.
11/25/19, 8:14 AM - +234 812 481 1464: Thanks Fesh for all your efforts though. Know that you are mostly appreciated
11/25/19, 8:14 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: However, the jupyter notebook is still there and it is fairly commented as I wrote some as we went along. So I will share that notebook shortly.

ie True + 3, 1 + 4 and 2 + False.
11/26/19, 3:17 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Yes, True
11/26/19, 3:18 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Figured it out after looking at more closely

11/26/19, 3:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is partly correct.
True is any value that is not the numerical 0, the string _None_ and of course _False_.

Anything that is not any of the above 3 evaluates to _False_/zero.

Any other, even if it is a negative number like -8 or 0.0004 is _positive/True_.
11/26/19, 3:26 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Ohhhhh wow, didn‚Äôt know those values also evaluate to True. Thanks for that insight

11/26/19, 4:35 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Further to what my oga have said. If I may explain it a little further from my understanding.
What is going on is adding 2 numpy arrays together.
In this type of addition, the output is simply the sum of corresponding elements. Notice how the middle elements in each array (4) and (1) add to 5
In Python, True is numerically equal to 1, and False is equal to 0. So if you check the math, it all makes sense.

11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip/Secret for the Day*
medium.com is a site for many wonderdul articles about almost anything.

You can find articles on code solutions for data science and algorithms to data structures and coding challenges/test.

The drag? You can only read so much article in a month (3 or so) for free before coming across the *You read a lot* message and inviting you to pay for unlimited access to articles.

Get over this by either of 2 ways:
- _disable cookies on your browser_.
- _Open the article in your browser's incognito mode_

Read to your fill. üòé

PS: Disabling cookies might have undesirable effects on the rest of your browsing experience so option 2 is more elegant.

11/27/19, 8:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The _call()_ method take one argument. It evaluates if it has a positive value and prints true if it does and false if not.

call(1-1) is same as call(0).
Since 0 is not positive (remember 0, None and False are _valueless_ entities), it returns *false*.

On call(1-2) which is call(-1), the argument has a positive value since it is  not any of the 3 non-values. So the function evaluate to true.
11/27/19, 8:53 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I guess all values(integer) except 0 evaluates to FALSE.

11/30/19, 8:21 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Yea
11/30/19, 3:41 PM - +234 815 457 9644: Good day guys, I did some analysis on a dataset a twitter user provided https://twitter.com/__olamilekan__/status/1200003409014861824. The link to the repo is: https://github.com/Uchencho/Analyzing-Naira-Land-Data 

Kindly provide any suggestions and feedback. Thanks.
11/30/19, 4:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: wow. This is a great dataset.
Good EDA so far in the repo.
NLP on select topics in this data can be very very powerful. Nairaland is the quintessential Nigerian digital square.
11/30/19, 4:53 PM - +234 815 457 9644: My thoughts too.
My sentiment analysis needs upgrading definitely
11/30/19, 5:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Topic modelling and summary will be interesting on it too.

Get a real life feeler of what Nigerians care about from their own mouth. It will be like a reality show unscripted. I'll like to work such data sometime.
11/30/19, 5:09 PM - +234 815 457 9644: The link to the dataset is there(its quite heavy). Have a stab at it.

If anyone can share code to the questions I provided at the end, I would be really grateful. That part gave me a lot of headache üòÖ
11/30/19, 5:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: kk.
I will try and take a look and contribute when I can.
11/30/19, 5:20 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Awesome

12/2/19, 10:01 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Been awfully quiet in here the past week. Permit me to welcome to you a week I'm hoping will be jammed and beginners can continue to learn.
12/2/19, 10:02 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Apologies for the radio silence. I'm hoping to give more time in here this week all things being equal.

12/2/19, 2:43 PM - +972 54-226-9638: Could questions and/or quizzes and the solutions thereof be posted on GitHub as opposed to via downloads here on WhatsApp? Much appreciated!
12/2/19, 2:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of course.
Nice suggestion.
12/2/19, 2:46 PM - +972 54-226-9638: Thanks
12/2/19, 2:46 PM - +234 816 398 2854: And a new repo can be opened for it
12/2/19, 2:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We already have a notebook of the solution shared here as well as the questions.

So I will create a github repo that we will increment it adding a jupyter notebook for each solution.

Thanks @972542269638

https://github.com/ifebuche/AskPyFesh_Group
12/2/19, 3:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So far, it has the two notebooks from the first two meetings and as well as the solution to the first exercise.
