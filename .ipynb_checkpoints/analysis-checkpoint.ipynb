      "265 10/23/19, 10:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If this is the first programming language you are learning then you are in luck.\n",
      "266 Python is a high level programming language. This means it is closer to human language than machine language. So pretty much every line of python at a closer look, will be readable just like everyday sentences. Well, mostly.\n",
      "267 10/23/19, 10:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the most puzzling questions for me starting off was: _what can I do with the knowledge of this language_\n",
      "268 If you have not asked yourself this question, I'm not sure what you can take away from this group but just maybe you will get a bit more clarity after this short session.\n",
      "269 10/23/19, 10:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python is a very versatile language and can be used to develop Python can be used to develop different things like web applications, graphic user interface based applications, software development application, scientific and numeric applications, network programming, Games and 3D applications and other business applications.\n",
      "270 10/23/19, 10:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some of the popular services heavily built around python include:\n",
      "271 Google\n",
      "272 YouTube\n",
      "273 Quora\n",
      "274 Dropbox\n",

      "277 Spotify...\n",
      "278 10/23/19, 10:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: And... Instagram!\n",
      "279 10/23/19, 10:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the factors driving the adoption of this language today is its suitability for data and data related operations.\n",
      "280 10/23/19, 10:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of all the various things python can lend itself to, we are mostly going to gravitate towards data analytics and web development. This are arguably two of the most prominent uses of this languages.\n",
      "281 10/23/19, 10:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: More so, Python is a magnificent scripting language very good at achieving automation of processes.\n",
      "282 10/23/19, 10:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To cap up this introduction at the 15minute mark I am going to ask anyone on their computer to pull up the command prompt so we write our very first python program. It consists of a form of ritual in every language: hello world.\n",
      "283 10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you followed the setup text and tested it ok as advised, pull up a command prompt and type 'python' then hit the return key.\n",
      "284 You will have the python prompt looking like this\n",
      "285 >>>\n",
      "286 10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Type in\n",
      "287 _print(\"Hello World\")_\n",
      "288 Hit the return key.\n",
      "289 You just wrote your first script in python.\n",
      "290 10/23/19, 10:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will now outline some resources we can use for learning.\n",
      "291 On a desktop, I will recommend using the *jupyter notebook*\n",
      "292 To get it, download and install Anaconda from this link\n",
      "293 https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",
      "294 At installation, remember to check the box asking to add it to _PATH_ or _environmental variable_\n",
      "295 10/23/19, 10:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have a low memory PC, don't bother installing Anaconda. It might slow things down for you.\n",
      "296 You can install jupyter notebook and it's dependencies by opening your command prompt and typing\n",
      "297 _pip install jupyter notebook_\n",
      "298 I'm presuming you already have python installed and have an internet connection.\n",
      "299 10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To launch the notebook, create a new folder somewhere on your desktop, and open it up.\n",
      "300 Hold down the shift key and right click on a blank area (making sure nothing is selected if the folder has any contents), select _open command prompt (or powershell) here_ depending on the version of windows you are using.\n",
      "301 This opens a command prompt in that very directory/folder/location.\n",
      "302 Type:\n",
      "303 _jupyter notebook_\n",
      "304 Hit enter. The notebook fires up and opens on a browser.\n",
      "305 If you are on a Mac or Linux please indicate later if you will need some guidance.\n",
      "306 10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you can reach a browser but cannot afford to install packages, the site pythonanywhere.com has resources for you.\n",
      "307 10/23/19, 10:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are on a mobile, get the app _SoloLearn_.\n",
      "308 The _Code playground_ can be used to write and save code.\n",
      "309 10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, one of the best _free_ resource I have come across for learning this language is w3schools.com/python\n",
      "310 I will refer to it a lot and will practically follow its outline. Make it your encyclopedia.\n",
      "311 10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will stop here for some questions from the house.\n",
      "312 10/23/19, 10:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good evening and welcome once again.\n",
      "313 10/23/19, 10:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll call it a day at 11:15pm Lagos time.\n",
      "314 10/23/19, 10:51 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Good evening. You said Python is used for web development.\n",
      "315 1. Does it mean that HTML, CSS and JavaScript are outdated?\n",
      "316 2. I'm a newbie in coding and which would you recommend I learn for web development between python and the ones I listed above?\n",
      "317 10/23/19, 10:56 PM - Budo: Python is the way to go\n",
      "318 10/23/19, 10:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Web development can be complicated sometimes and many people misunderstand what is required. That said, there are two aspects of web development: the front end and the backend.\n",
      "319 The front end is where the items on _1_ in your list come in. JavaScript has frameworks for the back two. Node.js being the most popular.\n",
      "320 However, the backend is where the logic is the site resides. This is where python frameworks are a great asset. These include Django and Flask amongst others.\n",
      "321 For the web with python, after learning the basics, you will need to zero in on a web framework so you can develop the backend with it. When done, with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you get string a front end to it and have a full site from static to full fledged web apps like e-commerce and game sites.\n",
      "322 10/23/19, 10:58 PM - +234 903 182 7815: You can use Python for back end web development. Python web dev frameworks include: Django, Flask and Falcon.\n",
      "323 10/23/19, 10:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅\n",
      "324 10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: HTML and CSS are not programming languages, they are markup languages.\n",
      "325 10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Ohh thank you very much 🙂\n",
      "326 10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: HTML and CSS are essential for building a website.\n",
      "327 10/23/19, 11:00 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Python comes in as a replacement to PHP not those ones you mentioned.\n",
      "328 10/23/19, 11:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many thanks Sam. 👍👍\n",
      "329 Let's keep it simple for the beginners and not use too many terms that will confuse them for a take off.\n",
      "330 With time they will get the hang of it.\n",
      "331 10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 706 444 3217: so, Python and PHP can't be used together?\n",
      "332 10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Noted sir.\n",
      "333 Thanks for organizing the platform sir.\n",

      "335 10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: No you can't. They both do same thing.\n",
      "336 10/23/19, 11:03 PM - +234 706 444 3217: okay\n",
      "337 10/23/19, 11:03 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks bro\n",
      "338 10/23/19, 11:05 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: @Pascal, which one is betterjupyter or anaconda\n",
      "339 10/23/19, 11:06 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Is it advisable to use cmd for coding?\n",
      "340 10/23/19, 11:07 PM - +234 706 214 9878: Thanks Fesh for this wonderful session!\n",
      "341 10/23/19, 11:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Jupyter notebook is an environment for writing code. Anaconda is an assemblage of tools and libraries put together for ease of use by developers and one of the many environments in it is the jupyter notebook. Spyder is another environment and it is included in the Anaconda package.\n",
      "342 10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you went through the reference text you will see that though you can write code in the command prompt after teaching the python prompt, you have no way of saving it.\n",
      "343 For that it is not advisable to to do as it is mostly a waste of time.\n",
      "344 Use it when you are running your scripts. Something we will get to explain going forward.\n",
      "345 10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You are welcome Henry. ✌️\n",
      "346 10/23/19, 11:11 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks  Fesh\n",

      "350 10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I want to be like u\n",
      "351 10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first for you and for all new people is to get your own computer, install python and get the jupyter notebook.\n",
      "352 This way you will be ready to kick off. Scroll up a bit and find the installation guide.\n",
      "353 Then go ahead to w3schools.com/python and start familiarizing yourself with the basics. Ask questions here when you hit a snag.\n",
      "354 Real take homes will come much later as we progress.\n",
      "355 10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm here to help you get there and far beyond. Just keep moving.\n",

      "360 I will answer more questions as they come in on the session we had and generally on beginner stuff. It's important you setup your computer if you want to move along.\n",
      "361 For the rest of us who are not totally new, bear with us as we bring the great new guys up to speed.\n",
      "362 Meanhwile, drop any questions you have on any level of the language and myself and some experienced folk in here will give you a hand.\n",
      "363 Remember _there are several roads to Aba_.\n",

      "156 10/23/19, 10:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If this is the first programming language you are learning then you are in luck. python is a high level programming language. this means it is closer to human language than machine language. so pretty much every line of python at a closer look, will be readable just like everyday sentences. well, mostly.\n",
      "157 10/23/19, 10:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the most puzzling questions for me starting off was: _what can I do with the knowledge of this language_ if you have not asked yourself this question, i'm not sure what you can take away from this group but just maybe you will get a bit more clarity after this short session.\n",
      "158 10/23/19, 10:25 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: python is a very versatile language and can be used to develop python can be used to develop different things like web applications, graphic user interface based applications, software development application, scientific and numeric applications, network programming, games and 3d applications and other business applications.\n",
      "159 10/23/19, 10:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some of the popular services heavily built around python include: Google YouTube Quora Dropbox Yahoo Reddit spotify...\n",
      "160 10/23/19, 10:27 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: and... instagram!\n",
      "161 10/23/19, 10:28 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: one of the factors driving the adoption of this language today is its suitability for data and data related operations.\n",
      "162 10/23/19, 10:29 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: of all the various things python can lend itself to, we are mostly going to gravitate towards data analytics and web development. this are arguably two of the most prominent uses of this languages.\n",
      "163 10/23/19, 10:30 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: more so, python is a magnificent scripting language very good at achieving automation of processes.\n",
      "164 10/23/19, 10:31 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: to cap up this introduction at the 15minute mark i am going to ask anyone on their computer to pull up the command prompt so we write our very first python program. it consists of a form of ritual in every language: hello world.\n",
      "165 10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you followed the setup text and tested it ok as advised, pull up a command prompt and type 'python' then hit the return key. You will have the python prompt looking like this >>>\n",
      "166 10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Type in _print(\"Hello World\")_ Hit the return key. you just wrote your first script in python.\n",
      "167 10/23/19, 10:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will now outline some resources we can use for learning. On a desktop, I will recommend using the *jupyter notebook* To get it, download and install Anaconda from this link https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ at installation, remember to check the box asking to add it to _path_ or _environmental variable_\n",
      "168 10/23/19, 10:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have a low memory PC, don't bother installing Anaconda. It might slow things down for you. You can install jupyter notebook and it's dependencies by opening your command prompt and typing _pip install jupyter notebook_ i'm presuming you already have python installed and have an internet connection.\n",
      "169 10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To launch the notebook, create a new folder somewhere on your desktop, and open it up. Hold down the shift key and right click on a blank area (making sure nothing is selected if the folder has any contents), select _open command prompt (or powershell) here_ depending on the version of windows you are using. This opens a command prompt in that very directory/folder/location. Type: _jupyter notebook_ Hit enter. The notebook fires up and opens on a browser. if you are on a mac or linux please indicate later if you will need some guidance.\n",
      "170 10/23/19, 10:44 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: if you can reach a browser but cannot afford to install packages, the site pythonanywhere.com has resources for you.\n",
      "171 10/23/19, 10:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are on a mobile, get the app _SoloLearn_. the _code playground_ can be used to write and save code.\n",
      "172 10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, one of the best _free_ resource I have come across for learning this language is w3schools.com/python i will refer to it a lot and will practically follow its outline. make it your encyclopedia.\n",
      "173 10/23/19, 10:47 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: i will stop here for some questions from the house.\n",
      "174 10/23/19, 10:48 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: good evening and welcome once again.\n",
      "175 10/23/19, 10:48 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: we'll call it a day at 11:15pm lagos time.\n",
      "176 10/23/19, 10:51 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Good evening. You said Python is used for web development. 1. Does it mean that HTML, CSS and JavaScript are outdated? 2. i'm a newbie in coding and which would you recommend i learn for web development between python and the ones i listed above?\n",
      "177 10/23/19, 10:56 pm - budo: python is the way to go\n",
      "178 10/23/19, 10:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Web development can be complicated sometimes and many people misunderstand what is required. That said, there are two aspects of web development: the front end and the backend. The front end is where the items on _1_ in your list come in. JavaScript has frameworks for the back two. Node.js being the most popular. However, the backend is where the logic is the site resides. This is where python frameworks are a great asset. These include Django and Flask amongst others. for the web with python, after learning the basics, you will need to zero in on a web framework so you can develop the backend with it. when done, with basic knowledge of html and css, you get string a front end to it and have a full site from static to full fledged web apps like e-commerce and game sites.\n",
      "179 10/23/19, 10:58 pm - +234 903 182 7815: you can use python for back end web development. python web dev frameworks include: django, flask and falcon.\n",
      "180 10/23/19, 10:58 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: ✅\n",
      "181 10/23/19, 10:59 pm - +234 903 182 7815: html and css are not programming languages, they are markup languages.\n",

      "183 10/23/19, 10:59 pm - +234 903 182 7815: html and css are essential for building a website.\n",

      "186 10/23/19, 11:02 pm - +234 706 444 3217: so, python and php can't be used together?\n",
      "187 10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Noted sir. thanks for organizing the platform sir.\n",

      "194 10/23/19, 11:07 pm - +234 706 214 9878: thanks fesh for this wonderful session!\n",
      "195 10/23/19, 11:08 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: jupyter notebook is an environment for writing code. anaconda is an assemblage of tools and libraries put together for ease of use by developers and one of the many environments in it is the jupyter notebook. spyder is another environment and it is included in the anaconda package.\n",
      "196 10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you went through the reference text you will see that though you can write code in the command prompt after teaching the python prompt, you have no way of saving it. For that it is not advisable to to do as it is mostly a waste of time. use it when you are running your scripts. something we will get to explain going forward.\n",
      "197 10/23/19, 11:10 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: you are welcome henry. ✌️\n",

      "202 10/23/19, 11:12 pm - charles echefu #askpyfesh: i want to be like u\n",
      "203 10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first for you and for all new people is to get your own computer, install python and get the jupyter notebook. This way you will be ready to kick off. Scroll up a bit and find the installation guide. Then go ahead to w3schools.com/python and start familiarizing yourself with the basics. Ask questions here when you hit a snag. real take homes will come much later as we progress.\n",
      "204 10/23/19, 11:15 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: i'm here to help you get there and far beyond. just keep moving.\n",

      "208 10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's wrap ladies and gentlemen. I will answer more questions as they come in on the session we had and generally on beginner stuff. It's important you setup your computer if you want to move along. For the rest of us who are not totally new, bear with us as we bring the great new guys up to speed. Meanhwile, drop any questions you have on any level of the language and myself and some experienced folk in here will give you a hand. Remember _there are several roads to Aba_. A single issue can be solved in many ways. The best solution is the one that solves the problem. After that you try the fastest and the least resource sapping. best regards.\n",
      "209 10/23/19, 11:20 pm - paschal chukwuemeka amah: meets are in the incubator. we will stay here in the virtual world for a while and contemplate meet ups later. they sure are most likely to come.\n",
      "210 10/23/19, 11:21 pm - charles echefu #askpyfesh: i was actually asking for the time for the session\n",
      "211 10/23/19, 11:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok. They will be fortnightly if time permits. Either way, they will be announced days ahead. thanks for the clarification. ✌\n",

      "219 10/24/19, 8:18 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *#PythonTip_byFesh* Python is object oriented and almost everything in the language is an object. This is a very important aspect that determines a lot of things. Every object has its ```properties``` and ```methods``` . To work with each, one need know what properties they posses and what ```method``` they respond to. To find the type of an object do: _type(object)_ Eg: aList = [1, 2, \"Fred\"] aTuple = (1, 2, \"Fred\")  aList is a python list and possess the properties as well as responds to the methods of a list.  ```Properties``` : mutable, iterable.  ```Methods``` : append(), pop(), index(), sort() etc _aTuple_ is a Tuple. Essentially a python list but different in that it's ```immutable``` : cannot be changed once created. Responds to two methods _index()_  and _count()_. Being immutable they cannot be sorted, appended to, members popped etc. the object type determines what properties it possess and what methods it responds to.\n",
      "220 10/24/19, 8:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Teaser*: Find the basic data types in python, their properties and the methods they respond to. Google is your friend. Good morning from Lagos. ✌ _-fesh-_\n",
